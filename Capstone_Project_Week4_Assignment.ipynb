    " This project aims to help to identify the highly demanding business in the New York City in all its Boroughs. It will provide the insight of each Borough with number of venue category in each neighborhood. There is no doubt that anybody can success in own business if she/he choose the correct business and appropriate location where it is having high demand. Say for example, if we start a stationary store near to a college or school will have more demand rather starting it near to mall. Own business has its own merits like more freedom and independence working for yourself. It gives more satisfaction by creating employment and contributing to the country’s development. Most of the successful persons are having their own business. In order to identify the demanding business and location we have decided to use Data Science and Machine Learning algorithm because we both are thriving software developers learning new technologies and experiment it in our day to day life.\n",

    "#### Identify the demanding business and location to start a new business in New York City. \n",
    "New York city is the most populous city in the United States. The City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. As the population is high in this city, if we start a demanding business in the correct place, it will be more profitable.\n",

    "New York City comprises of 5 boroughs.\n",
    "We have to do the segmenting and clustering of neighborhood venues in each borough and analyze the more number of business category available in the borough to give recommendation for anybody who is willing to start new business in New York City.\n"

Using Python request library, the data can be downloaded, and by using json_normalize library the Json data can be converted into Pandas dataframe. \n",
    "Exploratory data analysis will be done to understand the data structure, purity and size. The model requires neighborhood venues, venue type, categories and venues geocode.\n",
    "One hot encoding will be used to convert the categorical data into numerical data. Many machine learning algorithms cannot work with categorical data directly. The categories must be converted into numbers.\n",
